# Office 365 Connect ASP.NET MVC sample using Microsoft Graph

Connecting to Office 365 is the first step every app must take to start working with Office 365 services and data. This sample shows how to connect and use Microsoft Graph (previously called Office 365 unified API) to send an email. It uses [Active Directory Authentication Library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj573266.aspx) to make OAuth2 call.

## Prerequisites

To use the Office 365 ASP.NET MVC Connect sample, you need the following:
* Visual Studio 2015 installed and working on your development computer. 

     > Note: This sample is written using Visual Studio 2015. If you're using Visual Studio 2013, make sure to change the compiler language version to 5 in the Web.config file:  **compilerOptions="/langversion:5**
* An Office 365 account. You can sign up for [an Office 365 Developer subscription](https://aka.ms/devprogramsignup) that includes the resources that you need to start building Office 365 apps.

     > Note: If you already have a subscription, the previous link sends you to a page with the message *Sorry, you canâ€™t add that to your current account*. In that case use an account from your current Office 365 subscription.

## Register the app

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. On the top bar, click on your account and under the **Directory** list, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application.
3. Click on **More Services** in the left hand nav, and choose **Azure Active Directory**.
4. Click on **App registrations** and choose **Add**.
5. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'MSGraphConnectAspNet' and select 'Web app/API' as the **Application Type**. For the Sign-on URL, enter *http://localhost:55065*. Click on **Create** to create the application.
6. While still in the Azure portal, choose your application, click on **Settings** and choose **Properties**.
7. Find the Application ID value and copy it to the clipboard.
8. Configure Permissions for your application:
9. In the **Settings** menu, choose the **Required permissions** section, click on **Add**, then **Select an API**, and select **Microsoft Graph**.
10. Then, click on Select Permissions and select **Sign in and read user profile** and **Send mail as a user**. Click **Select** and then **Done**.
11. In the **Settings** menu, choose the **Keys** section. Enter a description and select a duration for the key. Click **Save**.
12. **Important**: Copy the key value. You won't be able to access this value again once you leave this pane. You will use this value as your app secret.


## Configure and run the app
1. Open **UnifiedApiConnect.sln** file. 
2. In Solution Explorer, open the **Web.config** file. 
3. Replace *ENTER_YOUR_CLIENT_ID* with the app ID of your registered Azure application.
4. Replace *ENTER_YOUR_SECRET* with the key of your registered Azure application.
3. Press F5 to build and debug. Run the solution and sign in to Office 365 with your organizational account.

     > Note: Copy and paste the start page URL address **http://localhost:55065/home/index**, to a different browser if you get the following error during sign in:**AADSTS70001: Application with identifier ad533dcf-ccad-469a-abed-acd1c8cc0d7d was not found in the directory**.
